# Recurse Database Server

Recurse Server is a simple and efficient server that allows you to store key-value pairs in memory. It is implemented using the Python standard library's `http.server` module. 

We could also use flask or django but hopefully this provides a bit of a challenge as it required to do some digging on how to use the `http.server` module. 

## Features

-   Store key-value pairs in memory
-   Accessible on `http://localhost:4000/`
-   Easy to use and run

## Usage

To run the Recurse Server, simply run the following command in your terminal:


`python3 webserver.py`

## Todo

During your interview, you will pair on saving the data to a file. You can start with simply appending each write to the file, and work on making it more efficient if you have time.
